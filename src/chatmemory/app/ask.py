"""The question-answering use case, independent of Discord.

Everything platform-specific stays in the adapter. This orchestrates:
resolve who is asking, resolve who will see the answer, produce it bounded by
that audience, and re-check every citation before it leaves.

One thing is asked alongside the answer rather than after it: what the
audience scoping cost this particular asker. Because retrieval is pre-scoped,
the answer itself carries no trace of what it could not look at, so a
separate probe has to go and see -- and it runs concurrently with the answer
so that a privileged asker's public reply is not measurably slower than a
restricted one's.
